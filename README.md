## Control Interface for TRAVA

### Improve Accessibility of Super 8 Cameras for Quadriplegic Individuals using Electrical Wheelchairs 

This project is motivated by the request from (_LIFT_)[http://lift.ca]\(Liaison for Independent Filmmaker of Toronto\) and independent filmmaker (_Adam Cohoon_)[https://www.youtube.com/user/arc23] for a design that enables powered wheelchair users to use the Braun Nizo Super 8 camera for filming activities. 

This design includes many features such as: 
* Wheelchair mount
* Accessible touchscreen interface
* Live relay of viewfinder to interface display
* Remote-controlled zooming, focusing, and driver system
* Motorized panning, tilting, and height adjustment
* Powered by Raspberry Pi

This repo is mainly for sharing the source code of the control interface, which uses __Kivy__ as the GUI framework.
